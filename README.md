A JQuery-based stylable replacement of the 'file' html input element.
Based on the code of the forked repository.
I stripped it of all the unnecessary css-candy and javascript code I didn't
need to make it ready to reuse.

The most important feature of the modification is that the invisible
input is never more moved around with the mouse pointer, but stays on
it's place, filling it's fake replacement.
